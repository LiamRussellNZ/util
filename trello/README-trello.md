# Trello

The scripts in this folder where created to extract data from a json extract file that gets generated by Trello.
Atlassian (the org who own's Trello) have made changes to how the product can be used. Namly how many users can be active in a workspace.

## To Run Script

Currently the script will look for a `json-board-extract.json` file. This file should be located in the same directory level as utilScripts. E.g if you have cloned the repo to `~/` then here there should be a `json-board-extract.json` file.

To run the script use Python3.
`python3 json-extract-from-python.py'
